Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

Software engineering involves all the activities in the development of a software solution.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

SDLC is a paradigmn that helps us manage cycles of a software in making. while programming captured the development cycle where the software design is actually implemented by writing computer instruction.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

An Agile SDLC is one that allows for Planning, Analysis, Desing and Development at any level of the software life cycle enhance it is best used when we are looking at launching quick. While Waterfall allows a sequencial workflow of working on each cycle in the SDLC and completing them before moving to the next phase or cycle in the SDLC.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
Requirements Engineering:

The key difference is the flexibility. Agile model is more flexible to go back and forth to all phases in the Cycle while Waterfall don't allow that. The best practical senario to working Agile is when we are looking at rolling a software to market to test or do a pilot study of it's feasibility. While Waterfall model are mostly used in cases, where the market demand is sure.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirement engineering is a stage in the SDLC that talks about understanding both the functional and non-functional things the intending software need to operate on. This can span from processes like navigate from home page to login page, etc. to the data and authentication flow.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Modularity is a concept that talks about organizing your codes into structure of concern for easy readability and maintainability. If our codes or project structure is organized properly, we would be able to add more functionality with ease and also make individual (unit) testing to each module without tempering other concerns.

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
Version Control Systems:

Testing is a very important concept in Software development; because it is unrealistic to ship a software that doesn't meet customer need. This testing ranges from difference level; starting with just testing a particular subroutine (unit testing), to testing a complete module/services and their respective level (integration testing), to testing the entire system (system testing). The acceptance testing is a test that check if the customer complains have been met with the already developed system.

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Software Project Management:

Version control system help us to manage different version/levels/steps of our software development processes.

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software Maintenance:

A Software Project Manager is someone whom is responsible for overseeing and managing the complete lifecycle of software idea conception to software delivery.

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

Software maintenance involves taking a careful look at the already deployed software solution; then looking at upgrading some of it failing or faulty part.

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
